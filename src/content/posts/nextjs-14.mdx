# Introduction to Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings significant improvements to the developer experience and application performance. Let's explore the key features that make this version special.

## Server Actions

One of the most exciting features in Next.js 14 is Server Actions. They allow you to write server-side code directly in your React components:

```typescript
'use server'

async function submitForm(formData: FormData) {
  const name = formData.get('name')
  await saveToDatabase(name)
}
```

## Partial Prerendering (Preview)

Partial Prerendering is a new rendering model that combines static and dynamic content:

```typescript
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
      {/* This part is static */}
      <StaticContent />
      
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        {/* This part is dynamic */}
        <DynamicContent />
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## Improved Developer Experience

Next.js 14 includes several improvements to make development more efficient:

- Faster local development server
- Better error messages

- Improved hot module replacement

## Performance Optimizations
